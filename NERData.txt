Fifty-two  O

Thirty-seven  O

the  O

Toxicity  O

were  O

both  O

was  O
28  O

was  O

These  O

Topotecan  B-DRUG
and  O
ifosfamide  B-DRUG
are  O
effective  O
in  O
the  O
treatment  O
of  O
various  O
solid  B-CANCER

.  O

Up  O
to  O
the  O
time  O
of  O
this  O
study  O
,  O
the  O
two  O
drugs  O
have  O
been  O
combined  O
just  O
once  O
(  O
Smith  O

)  O
.  O

Due  O
to  O
its  O
hematotoxicity  B-TOXI
,  O
topotecan  B-DRUG
has  O
been  O
used  O
predominantly  O
within  O
monochemotherapy  O
protocols  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
topotecan  B-DRUG
and  O
alkylating  B-DRUG
agents  I-DRUG
is  O
supra-additive  O
in  O
many  O
preclinical  O
models  O
.  O

This  O
phase-I  O
trial  O
was  O
primarily  O
performed  O
to  O
evaluate  O
the  O
maximum  O
tolerable  O
dose  O
(  O
MTD  O
)  O
and  O
dose-limiting  O
toxicity  O
(  O

of  O

chemotherapy  O
with  O
topotecan  B-DRUG
and  O
ifosfamide  B-DRUG
using  O
a  O
5-day  O
schedule  O
.  O

A  O
secondary  O
goal  O
was  O
to  O
estimate  O
the  O
response  O

in  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
heavily  O
pretreated  O
patients  O
with  O
advanced  B-CANCER
solid  I-CANCER
tumors  I-CANCER
.  O

The  O
pharmacokinetics  O
of  O
topotecan  B-DRUG
were  O
preliminarily  O
determined  O
in  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
.  O

A  O

with  O

chemotherapy  O
,  O
received  O
a  O
total  O
of  O
24  O
courses  O
of  O
chemotherapy  O
at  O
three  O
dose-levels  O
of  O
topotecan  B-DRUG
.  O

Ifosfamide  B-DRUG
was  O
administered  O
by  O
intravenous  O
infusion  O
over  O
3  O
h  O
immediately  O
followed  O
by  O
a  O
30-min  O

of  O

during  O
chemotherapy  O
as  O
a  O

G-CSF  B-DRUG

was  O
non-hematologic  O
;  O

were  O
observed  O
in  O

Two  O
treatment-related  B-TOXI
deaths  I-TOXI
occurred  O
.  O

No  O
clinical  O
remissions  O
occurred  O
in  O
11  O
evaluable  O
patients  O
.  O

The  O
pharmacokinetics  O
of  O
topotecan  B-DRUG
were  O
relatively  O
similar  O
in  O
our  O
patients  O
and  O
supported  O
findings  O
in  O
recent  O
literature  O
.  O

The  O
MTD  O
of  O

This  O

gemcitabine  B-DRUG
,  O
and  O
ifosfamide  B-DRUG
is  O
not  O

On  O

Gemcitabine  B-DRUG

In  O

suggest  O
that  O
the  O

thus  O
reducing  O

The  O
combination  O

had  O
a  O

than  O
expected  O
incidence  O
of  O

Although  O
the  O

Our  O

However  O

this  O

Onyx-015  B-DRUG
can  O
kill  O
tumor  O
cells  O
by  O
mechanisms  O
that  O
are  O
distinct  O
from  O
chemotherapeutic  O
agents  O
and  O
may  O
therefore  O
have  O
activity  O
among  O
patients  O
who  O
have  O
failed  O
first-line  O
chemotherapy  O
.  O

The  O
24  O
patients  O
included  O
in  O
this  O
analysis  O
had  O
failed  O
first-line  O
therapy  O
with  O
5-FU  B-DRUG
/  I-DRUG
leucovorin  I-DRUG
,  O
79  O
%  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
failed  O
two  O

more  O
regimens  O
and  O
58  O
%  O
had  O
failed  O

Despite  O
the  O
extensive  O
prior  O
therapy  O
,  O
the  O
median  O
survival  O
of  O
these  O
patients  O
was  O
10.7  O
months  O
,  O
46  O

were  O
alive  O
at  O
1  O
year  O
and  O

In  O
all  O
,  O
11  O
patients  O
(  O
46  O

)  O
had  O
stable  O
disease  O
at  O
the  O
completion  O
of  O
the  O
four  O
planned  O
viral  O
treatments  O
(  O
3  O

.  O

The  O
median  O
survival  O
of  O
this  O
group  O
of  O
patients  O
was  O
19  O
months  O
,  O
suggesting  O
that  O
stable  O
disease  O
may  O
be  O
an  O
important  O
predictor  O
of  O
benefit  O
with  O
oncolytic  O

.  O

Eight  O
of  O
the  O
11  O
patients  O
with  O
stable  O
disease  O
at  O
3  O
months  O
demonstrated  O
a  O
unique  O
radiographic  O
pattern  O
of  O
transient  O
enlargement  O
of  O
tumor  O
masses  O
(  O
10-48  O
%  O
)  O
after  O
the  O
initial  O
infusions  O
of  O
Onyx-015  B-DRUG
,  O
followed  O
by  O
radiographic  O
evidence  O
of  O
extensive  O
tumor  O
necrosis  O
and  O
regression  O
.  O

The  O
initial  O
enlargement  O
and  O
subsequent  O
tumor  O
necrosis  O
resulted  O
in  O
a  O
prolonged  O
time  O
to  O
achieve  O
objective  O
tumor  O
regression  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
transient  O
enlargement  O
of  O
the  O
tumor  O
masses  O
may  O
have  O
resulted  O
in  O
premature  O
removal  O
of  O
responding  O
patients  O
.  O

Treatment  O

eight  O
patients  O
was  O
stopped  O

Studies  O
performed  O

cells  O
indicate  O
that  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG

is  O
reduced  O
by  O
adding  O
AGP  B-DRUG

the  O
sensitivity  O

restored  O
by  O
displacing  O

The  O
purpose  O

A  O
pharmacokinetic  O
study  O
of  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
was  O
performed  O
in  O
the  O

consolidation  O
therapy  O
(  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG

carboplatin  B-DRUG

in  O
each  O
patient  O
.  O

In  O
these  O
cycles  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
was  O
administered  O
alone  O
and  O
with  O
two  O
different  O
doses  O
(  O
600  O
and  O
1,200  O

)  O
of  O
concurrent  O
clindamycin  B-DRUG

The  O
sequence  O
of  O
the  O
three  O
treatments  O
was  O
randomly  O
assigned  O
in  O
each  O
patient  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
avoid  O
the  O
same  O
order  O
of  O
treatments  O
.  O

Paclitaxel  B-DRUG
pharmacokinetics  O
were  O
partly  O
modified  O
by  O
the  O
concurrent  O
administration  O
of  O
clindamycin  B-DRUG
.  O

C  O
(  O
max  O
)  O
and  O
AUC  O
(  O
0-last  O
)  O
of  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
were  O
significantly  O
higher  O
when  O
the  O
drug  O
was  O
given  O
alone  O
than  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
coadministered  O
with  O
1,200  O
mg  O
clindamycin  B-DRUG
.  O

Moreover  O
,  O
AGP  B-DRUG
concentrations  O
seem  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
small  O
but  O
statistically  O
significant  O
influence  O
on  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
pharmacokinetic  O
,  O
since  O
AUC  O
(  O
0-last  O
)  O
showed  O
a  O
positive  O
significant  O
correlation  O
with  O
AGP  B-DRUG
plasma  O
concentration  O
when  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
was  O
given  O
alone  O
.  O

The  O
linear  O
relation  O
was  O
lost  O
when  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
was  O
coadministered  O
with  O
1,200  O
mg  O
clindamycin  B-DRUG
.  O

Toxicity  O
was  O
not  O
influenced  O
by  O
the  O
coadministration  O
of  O
clindamycin  B-DRUG
.  O

The  O
hypothesis  O
that  O
clindamycin  B-DRUG
could  O
affect  O
paclitaxel  B-DRUG
pharmacokinetics  O
seems  O
to  O
be  O
verified  O
with  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
changes  O
induced  O
by  O

the  O
